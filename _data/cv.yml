    - title: Software Engineer (Site Reliability Engineer)
      institution: Cisco Systems, Bangalore, India
      year: 2021 - 2023
      description:
        -  Led the development of a self-service application using Python and JavaScript that automates database administrator steps performed during OS upgrade on 300+ on-prem hosts. Lowered the overall time consumed from 4 hours to 15 minutes, achieving cost savings exceeding $300K annually.
        - Built RESTful APIs that powered a real-time SLA analytics dashboard (p99 latency less than 100 ms). The tool enabled access to key performance indicators such as MTTR and incident density across 2500 monthly tickets, enhancing operational decision-making.
        - Spearheaded the enhancement of three applications to accommodate the new multi-tenant architecture in Oracle databases. Maintained Apache, Redis, Flask, and corresponding CI/CD pipelines that accelerated the deployments.

      institution: Cisco Systems, Bangalore, India
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Automated the patching of 800+ Oracle databases. Pluggable databases were migrated from the source to the pre-patched target container database, reducing system downtime from 2 hours to near zero for read operations while maintaining millisecond-level interruptions for write operations

    - title: Summer Research Intern
      institution: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Implemented authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol with perfect forward secrecy. The algorithm uses a prime order subgroup generator instead of the traditional primitive root. The implementation was found to be around 8 times faster than the conventional method without compromising on security.
