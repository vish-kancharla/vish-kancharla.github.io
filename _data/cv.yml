      description:
        - Led the development of a self-service application using Python and JavaScript that automates database administrator steps performed before and after OS is upgraded/patched on 300+ on-prem hosts. Incorporated various workflows for ERP and FMW Oracle databases. Eliminated manual efforts and brought down the overall time consumed by 40%.
        - Developed dynamic backend APIs for more accessible analytics and visualization to understand various metrics agreed upon in the service level agreement. The dashboard enables real-time access to key performance indicators such as incident resolution times and provides insights on previously cluttered data.
        - Spearheaded enhancement of three applications to accommodate the new multitenant architecture in Oracle databases. Maintained Apache, Redis, Flask, and corresponding CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure that accelerated the team’s deployments.

      description:
        - Automated the patching of 800+ Oracle databases. Pluggable databases were migrated from the source to the pre-patched target container database, reducing system downtime from 2 hours to near zero for read operations while maintaining millisecond-level interruptions for write operations

    - title: Summer Research Intern
      institution: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Implemented authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol with perfect forward secrecy. The algorithm uses a prime order subgroup generator instead of the traditional primitive root. The implementation was found to be around 8 times faster than the conventional method without compromising on security.
