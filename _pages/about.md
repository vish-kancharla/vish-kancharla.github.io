Hey, I'm Vishal! I'm currently diving into my **MS in Computer Science** at the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). Before that, I spent a couple of years at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) as a **Software Engineer (Site Reliability)**, where I built **self-service web applications** that automated Oracle database tasksâ€”cutting manual effort, reducing execution time, and scaling the number of databases under the team's management. I also maintained and optimized the team's **development infrastructure**, improving **CI/CD pipelines**, managing **Apache web servers**, and in-house **Sentinel Redis**.  

At UMN, I'm exploring **Machine Learning**, with a focus on **Graph Neural Networks**. Beyond coursework in **Cloud Computing, NLP, and AI**, I also served as a **Teaching Assistant** for [Computational Biology](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/biol3004/research-areas/computational-microbiology?authuser=0) and [Machine Learning for Healthcare](https://yoga-varatha.github.io/ml4health-umn/).  

I enjoy working across the stack, from **ML** to **cloud infrastructure** and **web developement**. If you're curious about what I'm working on, check out my **[Projects](projects)** or **[Blogs](blog)** tabâ€”where I document my latest work, share insights from my **CS journey**, and sometimes write about what Iâ€™ve learned that day.  

And when I'm not exploring different corners of CS, you'll probably find me picking up a non-fiction book ðŸ˜„
